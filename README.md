# MongoDB Practice Project

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with key **MongoDB operations**. The goal is to master essential database skills such as **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations and explore **advanced queries** for efficient data manipulation and analysis. By working on this project, you will build a solid foundation in MongoDB, an essential tool for back-end development.

## **Topics Covered**
1. **Create Operation**:  
   - Insert single and multiple documents into a collection.  
   - Learn to structure data for optimal query performance.  

2. **Read Operation**:  
   - Query specific documents using `find()`.  
   - Filter results using conditions (`$gt`, `$lt`, `$eq`, etc.).  
   - Sort, limit, and project data for efficient output.  

3. **Update Operation**:  
   - Update specific fields using operators like `$set`, `$inc`, and `$push`.  
   - Update multiple documents at once with `updateMany()`.  

4. **Delete Operation**:  
   - Remove specific documents using `deleteOne()` and `deleteMany()`.  
   - Learn to delete data based on conditions.  

5. **Advanced Query**:  
   - Explore advanced operators like `$or`, `$and`, `$in`, `$regex`, and more.  
   - Use **aggregation** to analyze data and create custom pipelines.  
   - Master **indexing** to improve query performance.  

## **How to Use**
1. Set up a **MongoDB environment** (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas).  
2. Open the **MongoDB Shell (mongosh)** or **MongoDB Compass** for a graphical interface.  
3. Create a practice database (like `practiceDB`) and add sample collections (`students`, `products`, `orders`, etc.).  
4. Perform CRUD operations and run advanced queries on the sample data.  

## **Requirements**
- **MongoDB** installed locally or a cloud-based MongoDB Atlas account.  
- Basic knowledge of **JavaScript-like query syntax** used in MongoDB.  
- Familiarity with back-end development concepts.  

## **Example Collections**
1. **Students Collection**: For practicing queries on student records.  
2. **Products Collection**: For learning how to manage e-commerce product data.  
3. **Orders Collection**: For exploring queries on customer orders and purchases.
